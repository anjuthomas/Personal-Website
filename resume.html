<br>
Interned during the summer as a Quality Analyst. Helped populate the Forkworld database with various
restaurants in the Berkeley and Elk Grove region in California. Attending regular meetings with the Netvarth
team, I was also able to find corrections, create video tutorials, develop a user guide manual (using Jing &
Snagit), and share my ideas on the design and development of the Forkworld restaurant management system.

<B>Virtual Lab (2011)</B>
~ Created a virtual lab for the Immunology department at UC Berkeley to train senior students to perform a real
lab. It was created using BYOB (Build Your Own Blocks), a graphical language based on Scratch. Includes
captions, option to switch between parts of the virtual lab, mini quizzes, and interactive tools for the user. The
virtual lab also helps save resources by preventing unnecessary waste of lab supplements.

<br>
<B>Speech Synthesis (2011)</B>
~ Created a sound based application in BYOB that converts text to speech. Was chosen as one of the top 5
projects in a class of over 200 students to present as part of the CS-Education day hosted at Berkeley.
The project allows people to hear the sounds associated with each letter, words, or sentences without using an
online application. This tool can assist the visually impaired, those with reading disabilities, or can help learn
the pronunciation of unfamiliar words. Though the project was not able to be fully perfected or encompass all
exceptions in the English language due to time restraints, it performs a reasonably good job as a text to speech
translator.
